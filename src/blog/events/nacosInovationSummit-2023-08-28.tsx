        The Nigeria Association of Computing Students (NACOS) National Summit, a
        highly anticipated event which was originally scheduled to take place on
        28th - 31st August 2023 at our beloved school University of Lagos,
        Nigeria, has been postponed by the National Executive Council of The
        Nigeria Association of Computing Students (NACOS). Due to unforeseen
        circumstances, it became necessary to reschedule the event for a later
        date.

      <p>
        NACOS is committed to delivering a world-class summit that fosters
        innovation, collaboration, and knowledge sharing among computing
        students and professionals. Unfortunately, a series of unavoidable
        events compelled them to make this difficult decision. They assure all
        stakeholders, participants, and partners that the NACOS National
        Innovation Summit will indeed take place at a new date and location,
        which will be announced shortly. The team is working diligently to
        finalize all arrangements to ensure a seamless and enriching experience
        for everyone involved.

        The postponement came as a disappointment, but they view it as an
        opportunity to enhance the overall quality of the summit and expand its
        impact on the computing community. By taking this brief respite, they
        aim to make the event even more innovative, informative, and
        transformative for all attendees.
